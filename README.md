# Floribus
Floribus is a hybrid mobile app that allows you to quickly know what is the next departure time for any Florian√≥polis City bus line you want to take. It is currently available for Android users at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.floribus623404) and maybe, at some point in the future, it might be available to other platforms as well. Floribus is built with the [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/).

Floribus is specially handy when you have more than one option to get to your destination and you want to know what will be the first one to leave. But it is also very usefull if you have only one option =]
